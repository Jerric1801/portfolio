Other interesting features that scored well in feature importance, such as total leverage, provided a nuanced understanding of a company's risk profile, an essential consideration in China's dynamic economic landscape. The model also enabled us to identify features that were not as indicative of profitability and performance. These features, notably working capital turnover ratio, capital intensity, and book to market ratio, while offering interesting insights into the operational structure of the firms, were not as reliable as a metric for predicting profitability.
